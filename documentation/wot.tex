First of all, I would like to thank all the people involved in this project. To Raúl and Carlos, for their contributions and understanding. To Gonzalo de la Cruz, for his previous work, which has made the realisation of this project possible. To the clients/users for their feedback. 

Secondly, I would like to thank my friends and colleagues at the School of Computer Engineering of Oviedo, for all these years of fellowship and mutual help. Specially I want to name Kike, Ángel, Edu, Garnacho, Íñigo, Cuesta, Migi and Fidalgo. 

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for all the support they have given me over the years, and my brother Neizan, who has contributed to this project with the front and back cover.
