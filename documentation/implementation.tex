\section{Programming languages}

There were two programming languages considered for the implementation of the system, \textbf{C} and \textbf{Java}.

Considering that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The author and only developer of the system has worked with Java throughout his university studies, but only used C in one subject and in some of his personal projects.

    \item Java is probably less efficient than C when executing the genetic and greedy algorithms.

    \item Java code is more easy to run in other systems than C code.

    \item The program is going to be executed only a few times a year.
\end{itemize}

For this reasons, even if C would be faster in execution, because the program will not be running every day, and taking into account the other two advantages, Java was the language of choice for implementing the system.
