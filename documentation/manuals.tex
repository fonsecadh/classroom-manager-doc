\subsection*{NAME}

\begin{description}
    \item classmanager - manages the classrooms and groups of the School of Computing Engineering of Oviedo.
\end{description}


\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{classmanager} \textit{OPTION} [\textit{FILE...}]
\end{description}


\subsection*{DESCRIPTION}

The \textit{classmanager} utility assigns classes to groups in the School for a given semester. In addition, it allows queries to be made on the classrooms to obtain those available in a range of dates and schedules. Finally, the utility has a built-in tool that allows for automatic conversion of the files currently used by the school into files compatible with the system. 

A \textit{FILE} represents a configuration file. Each option requires one or more configuration files. If a file is not provided, or if the file cannot be parsed due to lack of permissions, the utility will notify the user of the error. The same goes for the required data not submitted in the configuration file.

        \end{description}
\end{description}


\subsection*{REGULAR EXPRESSIONS}

Three types of regular expressions designed for this project can be used in the \textit{PREFERENCES} and \textit{RESTRICTIONS} files. The three types are taken into account when using them in the name section of a group's code (\textit{subject.type.\textbf{name}}).

The first type involves using the asterisk (*) to indicate that the preference or restriction applies to both English and Spanish groups of a particular type of class (e.g. CVVS.L.*).

The second type uses the addition (+) to indicate that the preference or restriction should apply only to the Spanish groups (e.g. CVVS.L.+).

The last type employs the question mark (?) in the same way as the second type except that the groups concerned are English groups (e.g. CVVS.L.?).


\subsection*{EXIT STATUS}

The program can terminate in two states: \textit{OK} and \textit{ERROR}. The OK status indicates that the execution was completed without problems, while the ERROR status implies that the operation could not be carried out as expected due to an error. The detailed error is recorded in the \textit{LOG} file generated by the utility.


\subsection*{NOTES}

Make sure that all CSV files have a header with the column names, because the program expects such a header to exist. Otherwise it will skip the first row of the CSV. Also, the CSV files cannot have empty rows or the utility will complain.

\subsection*{BUGS}


Occasionally an error message will be displayed \textit{after} the message indicating that the program has terminated with error status. It should appear \textit{before} this message. However, repeating the execution may make it appear where expected. 

If you find a bug, you can create an Issue in \href{https://github.com/fonsecadh/classroom-manager-code}{this repository} or send an email to UO258318 AT uniovi DOT es.
