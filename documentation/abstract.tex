\chapter*{Abstract}

The main goal of this project is to analyse, formalise and solve the problem of assigning classrooms to groups at the School of Computer Engineering of the University of Oviedo. This is a challenging problem that arises every year in the School and is currently solved manually.

The problem is formalised as an optimisation problem based on a series of meetings with the school management. A greedy algorithm, guided by specific heuristics developed in the project, and a genetic algorithm, which conducts a global search to compute high quality solutions, are proposed to solve the problem.

In addition to providing a theoretical solution, the project builds a software prototype that implements the designed algorithms and on which experiments are carried out to obtain its optimal configuration.

The tool proves to be very effective at solving the problem.
