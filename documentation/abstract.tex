\chapter*{Abstract}

The problem of assigning classrooms to groups at the School of Computing Engineering of Oviedo is analysed, formalised and solved. A prototype is created on the basis of this theoretical analysis and some experiments are conducted on it to tune its configuration. The configuration will be defined in such a way that the assignments are of the highest possible quality.
